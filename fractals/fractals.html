<h3>Inroduction to fractals</h3>
<p> Fractals are exquisite structures produced by nature, hiding in plain sight all around us.

    They are tricky to define precisely, though most are linked by a set of four common fractal features: infinite intricacy, zoom symmetry, complexity from simplicity and fractional dimensions.
    
    The next fern you encounter will provide a great illustration of these features if you pause for a closer look. First, notice that the shape of the fern is intricately detailed. Remarkably, you can see that the leaves are shaped like little copies of the branches.
    
    In fact, the entire fern is mostly built up from the same basic shape repeated over and over again at ever smaller scales. Most astonishing of all, fractal mathematics reveals that this humble fern leaf is neither a one- nor an two-dimensional shape, but hovers somewhere in-between.</p>

<h3>Explaination to diagram above</h3>
<p>The tree is made up of branches of varying length ,even trunk is a branch. Branch is defined as line that may or may not have other branches.
    There is a 50% chance that a branch will exist or not , except for the trunk  . Each branch is also given an angle and 
    and postion with controlled randomness to mimic the nature . <br>
    Mathematically this pattern of repeated branches should extend till infinity , but due to lack of resources 
    pixels in computers and nutrients in real nature tree has to stop growing somewhere .
    The growth of branches stop as soon as length of branch is less than 4 pixels in length .<br>
    <br>

    The tree you are see above is almost unique in itself  (even more unique than a shuffled deck of playing card ) .
    <br> Please feel free to have a look or take a screenshot of this mathematical wonder .
